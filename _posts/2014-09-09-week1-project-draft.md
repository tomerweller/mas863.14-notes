This week I present an outline for my final project. 

**The Sunrise Bed** is a minimalistic platform bed that doubles as a sunrise alarm clock. A sunrise alarm clock utilizes [**dawn simulation**](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dawn_simulation), a technique that involves timing lights to come on gradually over a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours before awakening.

Setup an alarm clock from a smart phone tethered to the bed.

When triggered. light comes on gradually and enters through the eyelids triggering the body to begin its wake-up cycle, including the release of cortisol, so that by the time the light is at full brightness, you wake up on your own, without the need for an alarm.
