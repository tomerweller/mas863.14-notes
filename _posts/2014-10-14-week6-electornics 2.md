This week we took a more in-depth look at electornics. Our assignment was to design an "hello world" board from scratch and add at least a led and a switch and then mill and stuff it.

I've commited the ultimate sin and used autorouting. Not only that but the auto-route traces were too thin and some were damaged when milling. Due to time-constraints I will complete the task next week.
