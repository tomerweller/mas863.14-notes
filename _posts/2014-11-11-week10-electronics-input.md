This week was about devices. Our assignment was to design, mill, stuff & program a board that uses an output device.

As preperation for my final project I've decided to build a led array board that's controlled via a web interface.

As an exercise I also created a **Node.js** app that relays the serial input to a webclient that handles the conversion of the serial input into actual temperature and displays it.
