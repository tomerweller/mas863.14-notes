This week we learned about different molding & casting techniques. I've decided to cast a simple logo of my Member's week demo but at the last moment, since I use BLE beacons, I've decided to put a beacon inside the logo. 

###Final Result

![Final Front]({{ "/assets/week7/final_front.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

![Final Back]({{ "/assets/week7/final_back.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

###Process

![Design]({{ "/assets/week7/cad.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

![Mill]({{ "/assets/week7/mill.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

![Mold]({{ "/assets/week7/mold_start.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

I've been using [Estimotes](http://www.estimote.com) in my project, which are beautiful BLE Beacons. I opened these up and used the existing container as a mold.
